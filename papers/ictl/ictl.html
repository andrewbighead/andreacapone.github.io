            <p>
                Model checking plays a central role in the formal verification of dynamic systems. However, classical temporal logics such as CTL assume a complete and absolute perspective on truth, which limits their expressiveness in contexts where partial information and constructivity are essential. In this paper, we propose Intuitionistic Computation Tree Logic (ICTL), a novel temporal logic that integrates the semantics of CTL with the constructive principles of intuitionistic logic. ICTL adopts a birelational semantic framework
                which models the interaction between temporal evolution and the growth of knowledge over time.
                We formally define the syntax and semantics of ICTL, analyze its foundational properties, and show that key fixed-point characterizations of classical CTL hold in this setting. We then present an efficient model checking algorithm for the novel logic, maintaining the same PTIME complexity of classical CTL. ICTL is particularly well-suited for verifying properties in systems where traceability, information growth, and constructive reasoning are crucial, such as medical monitoring, geophysical data analysis, and database auditing. We validate our theoretical contributions through the extension of VITAMIN, a verification tool for Multi-Agent Systems, to support ICTL. Benchmarks confirm the practical tractability of ICTL model checking, reinforcing its potential for constructive temporal verification in real-world settings.
